TODO: Add a homework assignment to schedule this...

# Scheduling your one-on-one observations
* You have two tries on this assignment. If you feel that 
   your first observation did not go well, 
   you may request your instructor for a second try
* Contact you instructor to schedule two time slots to 
   observe you in action either during sections, 
   open labs or their office hours. 
   Scheduling your one-on-one session is due next week, 
   however you may choose a date anytime between now and week 7
   for the actual observation
