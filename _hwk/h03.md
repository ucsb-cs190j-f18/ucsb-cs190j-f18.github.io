# Lightning talks

Prepare a 3-5 minute talk about the research paper that you read and
summarized in [h02](/hwk/h02/). Your talk should summarize the key
contributions of the paper and your main takeaways from the
paper. Also comment on what aspects of the work would be interesting
to incorporate in our current tutor program. You may use a few slides
for your presentation or none at all. Open the floor for questions
after your talk.

While you are not presenting, attend carefully to whoever is talking
and be prepared to ask relevant questions.   

The lightning talks will be conducted over
two lectures as per the following assignment:

## Group 1: Talk on 11/09

1. TBD
2. TBD
3. TBD

etc.

## Group 2: Talk on 11/16

1. TBD
