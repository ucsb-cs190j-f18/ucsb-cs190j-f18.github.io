On 2018-11-09, we took the cards from the "What would you do" game from <https://csteachingtips.org>.

The students got in groups of three or four.

# 10 minutes: silent work

Each group was asked to work, individually and silently, on creating new cards for the game *from the perspective of tutors in the UCSB CS tutor program*, rather than from the perspective of CS faculty.

NOTE: I did *not* do this, but i should have asked them to mark the card as intended for "round 1" (general teaching/learning) or "round 2" (diversity/inclusion/bias related).

# 30 minutes: group work

Each group was asked to put all of their new cards in a pile.  

The instructor collected each set of cards, and swapped it with another groups cards (the swapped groups should be as far away from each other as possible, so as to avoid eavesdropping).

The next instruction was to just "play the game", but with one extra twist: before awarding the card to the best answer, the judge asks each participant to rate the card on a scale of 1 to 4:

* 1: nice try, bless your heart
* 2: it's ok I guess
* 3: pretty good
* 4: excellent

There is one optional extra level, but it should be rarely given: either zero times or at most one time in the entire game per person (it's like the golden buzzer on America's Got Talent:)

* 5: mind-blowingly amazingly insightful (this rating should rarely be given, perhaps never.)

The score is then totalled up and written on the card.   (For groups of 3 rather than 4, multiply final total by 4/3 to normalize the scores.)

# 15 minutes: lightning round

In this round, the judge only reads the card, and asks for ratings.  We don't play the game anymore---this is ensure we get a rating for each card.
